                    vh stands for viewport height and vw is for viewport width. Hence, setting an element to a width
                    value of 50vw means that the element will have a width that's 50% of the viewport size, and this
                    stays true when the viewport is resized.
                    Since viewport units are a percentage of the size of the viewport, it can seem at first glance that
                    specifying sizes as percentage values would be equivalent. The difference is that viewport units are
                    always a percentage of the total size of the viewport, while a percentage value applied on an
                    element is a percentage of the element’s parent, not necessarily the whole viewport.
